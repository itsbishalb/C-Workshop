/*
  Task:
    pointer arrays are useful for making
    variable size arrays in ANSI C
    and you'll probably be encountering them in current and future cw's
    increment through a char pointer array 
    (i.e. like int* numbers)
    and print out every character using
    a. normal indexing numbers[x]
    b. the insane (and bad practice) way [x]numbers
    c. pointer arithmetic 

    Sample Input: The moon is made out of cheese
    Expected Output:
    [T,h,e, ,m,o,o,n, ,i,s, ,m,a,d,e, ,o,u,t, ,o,f, ,c,h,e,e,s,e,]
    [T,h,e, ,m,o,o,n, ,i,s, ,m,a,d,e, ,o,u,t, ,o,f, ,c,h,e,e,s,e,]
    [T,h,e, ,m,o,o,n, ,i,s, ,m,a,d,e, ,o,u,t, ,o,f, ,c,h,e,e,s,e,]
